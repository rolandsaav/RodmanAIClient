## üèÄ Predictive Rebound Analysis in Basketball

Rebounds play a crucial role in basketball as they directly influence possession of the ball. Offensive rebounds provide teams with second-chance scoring opportunities, extending possessions and increasing the likelihood of scoring points. Therefore, leveraging predictive analytics to enhance offensive rebounding strategies can significantly impact a team's overall performance on the court.
Our Machine Learning model predicts offensive rebounds in basketball based on players' positions, offering various practical applications:

## Considerations
The model we made was trained off of NBA rebound data. This means the model is tuned to player positions that would occur in the NBA, meaning player positions that would not happen in the NBA will have unusual probabilities. If you encounter a probability that does not seem right, please keep this in mind.`;
